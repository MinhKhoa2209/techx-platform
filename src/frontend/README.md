# Frontend

Next.js storefront and server-side BFF.

```powershell
$env:CATALOG_API_URL='http://localhost:3001'
$env:ORDER_API_URL='http://localhost:3002'
$env:ORDER_API_KEY='local-demo-key'
npm run dev -w @techx/frontend
```

The browser calls only same-origin `/api/*` routes. `ORDER_API_KEY` is read only by server route handlers and must never use a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

The storefront uses Product v2 and Order v2 contracts. Catalog, facets, hero
product, price, promotion, availability, inventory, shipping, status, ETA, and
TTL are API/config driven. Routes, navigation, UI copy, presentation mappings,
and design tokens have centralized owners; production components do not embed
product fixtures or business-rule magic values. Checkout never requests card
details and clearly identifies itself as a non-transactional demo.

The BFF applies dependency timeouts and GET retries, forwards request IDs, rate-limits order creation to 20 attempts per client per minute, and maps dependency failures to structured responses. Orders remain ephemeral by design.

Local checks:

```powershell
npm run check -w @techx/frontend
npm run test -w @techx/frontend
npm run build -w @techx/frontend
./scripts/ui-hardcode-audit.ps1
```
